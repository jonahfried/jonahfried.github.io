          <h2>Art thou pale for weariness</h2>
          <h3>Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Art thou pale for weariness</p>
          <p>Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,</p>
          <p>Wandering companionless</p>
          <p>Among the stars that have a different birth,</p>
          <p>And ever changing, like a joyless eye</p>
          <p>That finds no object worth its constancy?</p>

          <p>How painful it is:</p>
          <p>For the rain to come a’falling here,</p>
          <p>Upon the strand at Miwa,</p>

          <h2>Faustina, or Rock Roses</h2>
          <h3>Elizabeth Bishop</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Tended by Faustina</p>
          <p>yes in a crazy house</p>
          <p>upon a crazy bed,</p>
          <p>frail, of chipped enamel,</p>
          <p>blooming above her head</p>
          <p>into four vaguely roselike</p>
          <p>flower-formations,</p>
          <br>
          <p>the white woman whispers to</p>
          <p>herself. The floorboards sag</p>
          <p>this way and that. The crooked</p>
          <p>towel-covered table</p>
          <p>bears a can of talcum</p>
          <p>and five pasteboard boxes</p>
          <p>of little pills,</p>
          <br>
          <p>most half-crystallized.</p>
          <p>The visitor sits and watches</p>
          <p>the dew glint on the screen</p>
          <p>and in it two glow-worms</p>
          <p>burning a drowned green.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the eighty-watt bulb</p>
          <p>betrays us all,</p>
          <br>
          <p>discovering the concern</p>
          <p>within our stupefaction;</p>
          <p>lighting as well on heads</p>
          <p>of tacks in the wallpaper,</p>
          <p>on a paper wall-pocket,</p>
          <p>violet-embossed, glistening</p>
          <p>with mica flakes.</p>
          <br>
          <p>It exposes the fine white hair,</p>
          <p>the gown with the undershirt</p>
          <p>showing at the neck,</p>
          <p>the pallid palm-leaf fan</p>
          <p>she holds but cannot wield,</p>
          <p>her white disordered sheets</p>
          <p>like wilted roses.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Clutter of trophies,</p>
          <p>chamber of bleached flags!</p>
          <p>-Rags or ragged garments</p>
          <p>hung on the chairs and hooks</p>
          <p>each contributing its</p>
          <p>shade of white, confusing</p>
          <p>as undazzling.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The visitor is embarrassed</p>
          <p>not by pain nor age</p>
          <p>nor even nakedness,</p>
          <p>though perhaps by its reverse.</p>
          <p>By and by the whisper</p>
          <p>says, "Faustina, Faustina. . ."</p>
          <p>Vengo, senora!"</p>
          <br>
          <p>On bare scraping feet</p>
          <p>Faustina nears the bed.</p>
          <p>She exhibits the talcum powder,</p>
          <p>the pills, the cans of "cream,"</p>
          <p>the white bowl of farina,</p>
          <p>requesting for herself</p>
          <p>a little conac;</p>
          <br>
          <p>complaining of, explaining,</p>
          <p>the terms of her employment.</p>
          <p>She bends above the other.</p>
          <p>Her sinister kind face</p>
          <p>presents a cruel black</p>
          <p>coincident conundrum.</p>
          <p>Oh, is it</p>
          <br>
          <p>freedom at last, a lifelong</p>
          <p>dream of time and silence,</p>
          <p>dream of protection and rest?</p>
          <p>Or is it the very worst,</p>
          <p>the unimaginable nightmare</p>
          <p>that never before dared last</p>
          <p>more than a second?</p>
          <br>
          <p>The acuteness of the question</p>
          <p>forks instantly and starts</p>
          <p>a snake-tongue flickering;</p>
          <p>blurs further, blunts, softens,</p>
          <p>separates, falls, our problems</p>
          <p>becoming helplessly</p>
          <p>proliferative.</p>
          <br>
          <p>There is no way of telling.</p>
          <p>The eyes say only either.</p>
          <p>At last the visitor rises,</p>
          <p>awkwardly proffers her bunch</p>
          <p>of rust-perforated roses</p>
          <p>and wonders oh, whence come</p>
          <p>all the petals.</p>

          <h3>by Percy Byshe Shelley</h3>

          <p>The fountains mingle with the river</p>
          <p>And the rivers with the ocean,</p>
          <p>The winds of heaven mix for ever</p>
          <p>With a sweet emotion;</p>
          <p>Nothing in the world is single;</p>
          <p>All things by a law divine</p>
          <p>In one spirit meet and mingle.</p>
          <p>Why not I with thine?—</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>See the mountains kiss high heaven</p>
          <p>And the waves clasp one another;</p>
          <p>No sister-flower would be forgiven</p>
          <p>If it disdained its brother;</p>
          <p>And the sunlight clasps the earth</p>
          <p>And the moonbeams kiss the sea:</p>
          <p>What is all this sweet work worth</p>
          <p>If thou kiss not me?</p>

          <h3>by William Shakespeare</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Those lips that Love’s own hand did make</p>
          <p>Breathed forth the sound that said ‘I hate,’</p>
          <p>To me, that languished for her sake:</p>
          <p>But when she saw my woeful state,</p>
          <p>Straight in her heart did mercy come,</p>
          <p>Chiding that tongue that ever sweet</p>
          <p>Was used in giving gentle doom,</p>
          <p>And taught it thus anew to greet:</p>
          <p>‘I hate’ she altered with an end,</p>
          <p>That followed it as gentle day</p>
          <p>Doth follow night, who like a fiend</p>
          <p>From heaven to hell is flown away.</p>
          <p>‘I hate’ from hate away she threw,</p>
          <p>And saved my life, saying ‘not you.’</p>

          <h2>A Wolf</h2>
          <h3>by Jorge Luis Borges</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Grey and furtive in the final twilight,</p>
          <p>he lopes by, leaving his spoor along the bank</p>
          <p>of this nameless river that has quenched the thirst</p>
          <p>of his throat, these waters that repeats no stars.</p>
          <p>Tonight, the wolf is a shade who runs alone</p>
          <p>and searches for his mate and feels cold.</p>
          <p>He is the last wolf in all of Angle-land.</p>
          <p>Odin and Thor know him. In a commanding</p>
          <p>house of stone a king has made up his mind</p>
          <p>to put an end to wolves. The powerful</p>
          <p>blade of your death has already been forged.</p>
          <p>Saxon wolf, your seed has come to nothing.</p>
          <p>To be cruel isn't enough. You are the last.</p>
          <p>A thousand years will pass and an old man</p>
          <p>will dream of you in America. What use</p>
          <p>can that future dream possibly be to you?</p>
          <p>Tonight the men who followed through the woods</p>
          <p>the spoor you left are closing in on you,</p>
          <p>grey and furtive in the final twilight</p>

          <h2>Jaberwocky</h2>
          <h3>by Lewis Carroll</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p>
          <p>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</p>
          <p>All mimsy were the borogoves,</p>
          <p>And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

          <p>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun</p>
          <p>The frumious Bandersnatch!”</p>

          <p>Long time the manxome foe he sought—</p>
          <p>So rested he by the Tumtum tree</p>
          <p>And stood awhile in thought.</p>
          <br>
          <p>And, as in uffish thought he stood,</p>
          <p>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,</p>
          <p>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,</p>
          <p>And burbled as it came!</p>
          <br>
          <p>One, two! One, two! And through and through</p>
          <p>The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!</p>
          <p>He left it dead, and with its head</p>
          <p>He went galumphing back.</p>
          <br>
          <p>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?</p>
          <p>Come to my arms, my beamish boy!</p>
          <p>O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”</p>
          <p>He chortled in his joy.</p>
