        <h2>Paradise Lost</h2>
        <h3>By John Milton</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon</p>
        <p>(So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide</p>
        <p>Timely interposes, and her monthly round</p>
        <p>Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n;</p>
        <p>With borrowd light her countenance triform</p>
        <p>Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth,</p>
        <p>And in her pale dominion checks the night.</p>
        <p>That spot to which I point is Paradise,</p>
        <p>Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre.</p>
        <p>Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.</p>

          <p>On the sea of the heavens</p>
          <p>Waves of cloud arise,</p>
          <p>The moon-a boat-</p>

          <h1>Insomnia</h1>
          <h3>By Elizabeth Bishop</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>The moon in the bureau mirror</p>
          <p>looks out a million miles</p>
          <p>(and perhaps with pride, at herself,</p>
          <p>but she never, never smiles)</p>
          <p>far and away beyond sleep, or</p>
          <p>perhaps she's a daytime sleeper.</p>
          <br>
          <p>By the Universe deserted,</p>
          <p>she'd tell it to go to hell,</p>
          <p>and she'd find a body of water,</p>
          <p>or a mirror, on which to dwell.</p>
          <p>So wrap up care in a cobweb</p>
          <p>and drop it down the well</p>
          <br>
          <p>into that world inverted</p>
          <p>where left is always right,</p>
          <p>where the shadows are really the body,</p>
          <p>where we stay awake all night,</p>
          <p>where the heavens are shallow as the sea</p>
          <p>is now deep, and you love me.</p>

          <h1>The Man-Moth</h1>
          <h3>By Elizabeth Bishop</h3>
          <p><i>Man-Moth: Newspaper misprint for “mammoth.”</i></p>
          <hr>

          <p>Here, above,</p>
          <p>cracks in the buildings are filled with battered moonlight.</p>
          <p>The whole shadow of Man is only as big as his hat.</p>
          <p>It lies at his feet like a circle for a doll to stand on,</p>
          <p>and he makes an inverted pin, the point magnetized to the moon.</p>
          <p>He does not see the moon; he observes only her vast properties,</p>
          <p>feeling the queer light on his hands, neither warm nor cold,</p>
          <p>of a temperature impossible to record in thermometers.</p>
          <br>
          <p>But when the Man-Moth</p>
          <p>pays his rare, although occasional, visits to the surface,</p>
          <p>the moon looks rather different to him. He emerges</p>
          <p>from an opening under the edge of one of the sidewalks</p>
          <p>and nervously begins to scale the faces of the buildings.</p>
          <p>He thinks the moon is a small hole at the top of the sky,</p>
          <p>proving the sky quite useless for protection.</p>
          <p>He trembles, but must investigate as high as he can climb.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Up the façades,</p>
          <p>his shadow dragging like a photographer’s cloth behind him</p>
          <p>he climbs fearfully, thinking that this time he will manage</p>
          <p>to push his small head through that round clean opening</p>
          <p>and be forced through, as from a tube, in black scrolls on the light.</p>
          <p>(Man, standing below him, has no such illusions.)</p>
          <p>But what the Man-Moth fears most he must do, although</p>
          <p>he fails, of course, and falls back scared but quite unhurt.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Then he returns</p>
          <p>to the pale subways of cement he calls his home. He flits,</p>
          <p>he flutters, and cannot get aboard the silent trains</p>
          <p>fast enough to suit him. The doors close swiftly.</p>
          <p>The Man-Moth always seats himself facing the wrong way</p>
          <p>and the train starts at once at its full, terrible speed,</p>
          <p>without a shift in gears or a gradation of any sort.</p>
          <p>He cannot tell the rate at which he travels backwards.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Each night he must</p>
          <p>be carried through artificial tunnels and dream recurrent dreams.</p>
          <p>Just as the ties recur beneath his train, these underlie</p>
          <p>his rushing brain. He does not dare look out the window,</p>
          <p>for the third rail, the unbroken draught of poison,</p>
          <p>runs there beside him. He regards it as a disease</p>
          <p>he has inherited the susceptibility to. He has to keep</p>
          <p>his hands in his pockets, as others must wear mufflers.</p>
          <br>
          <p>If you catch him,</p>
          <p>hold up a flashlight to his eye. It’s all dark pupil,</p>
          <p>an entire night itself, whose haired horizon tightens</p>
          <p>as he stares back, and closes up the eye. Then from the lids</p>
          <p>one tear, his only possession, like the bee’s sting, slips.</p>
          <p>Slyly he palms it, and if you’re not paying attention</p>
          <p>he’ll swallow it. However, if you watch, he’ll hand it over,</p>
          <p>cool as from underground springs and pure enough to drink.</p>

          <h1>Endymion</h1>
          <h3>By Oscar Wilde</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>The apple trees are hung with gold,</p>
          <p>And birds are loud in Arcady,</p>
          <p>The sheep lie bleating in the fold,</p>
          <p>The wild goat runs across the wold,</p>
          <p>But yesterday his love he told,</p>
          <p>I know he will come back to me.</p>
          <p>O rising moon! O Lady moon!</p>
          <p>Be you my lover’s sentinel,</p>
          <p>You cannot choose but know him well,</p>
          <p>For he is shod with purple shoon,</p>
          <p>You cannot choose but know my love,</p>
          <p>For he a shepherd’s crook doth bear,</p>
          <p>And he is soft as any dove,</p>
          <p>And brown and curly is his hair.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The turtle now has ceased to call</p>
          <p>Upon her crimson-footed groom,</p>
          <p>They grey wolf prowls about the stall,</p>
          <p>The lily’s singing seneschal</p>
          <p>Sleeps in the lily-bell, and all</p>
          <p>The violet hills are lost in gloom.</p>
          <p>O risen moon! O holy moon!</p>
          <p>Stand on the tope of Helice,</p>
          <p>And if my own true love you see,</p>
          <p>Ah! if you see the purple shoon,</p>
          <p>The hazel crook, the lad’s brown hair,</p>
          <p>The goat-skin wrapped about his arm,</p>
          <p>Tell him that I am waiting where</p>
          <p>The rushlight glimmers in the Farm.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The falling dew is cold and chill,</p>
          <p>And no bird sings in Arcady,</p>
          <p>The little fauns have left the hill,</p>
          <p>Even the tired daffodil</p>
          <p>Has closed its gilded doors, and still</p>
          <p>My lover comes not back to me.</p>
          <p>False moon! False moon! O waning moon!</p>
          <p>Where is my own true lover gone,</p>
          <p>Where are the lips vermilion,</p>
          <p>The shepherd’s crook, the purple shoon?</p>
          <p>Why spread that silver pavilion,</p>
          <p>Why wear that veil of drifting mist?</p>
          <p>Ah! thou hast young Endymion,</p>
          <p>Thou hast the lips that should be kissed!</p>

          <h1>Annabel Lee</h1>
          <h3>By Edgar Allan Poe</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>It was many and many a year ago,</p>
          <p>In a kingdom by the sea,</p>
          <p>That a maiden there lived whom you may know</p>
          <p>By the name of Annabel Lee;</p>
          <p>And this maiden she lived with no other thought</p>
          <p>Than to love and be loved by me.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I was a child and she was a child,</p>
          <p>In this kingdom by the sea,</p>
          <p>But we loved with a love that was more than love—</p>
          <p>I and my Annabel Lee—</p>
          <p>With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven</p>
          <p>Coveted her and me.</p>
          <br>
          <p>And this was the reason that, long ago,</p>
          <p>In this kingdom by the sea,</p>
          <p>A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling</p>
          <p>My beautiful Annabel Lee;</p>
          <p>So that her highborn kinsmen came</p>
          <p>And bore her away from me,</p>
          <p>To shut her up in a sepulchre</p>
          <p>In this kingdom by the sea.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,</p>
          <p>Went envying her and me—</p>
          <p>Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,</p>
          <p>In this kingdom by the sea)</p>
          <p>That the wind came out of the cloud by night,</p>
          <p>Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</p>
          <br>
          <p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love</p>
          <p>Of those who were older than we—</p>
          <p>Of many far wiser than we—</p>
          <p>And neither the angels in Heaven above</p>
          <p>Nor the demons down under the sea</p>
          <p>Can ever dissever my soul from the soul</p>
          <p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</p>
          <br>
          <p>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams</p>
          <p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</p>
          <p>And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes</p>
          <p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</p>
          <p>And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side</p>
          <p>Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,</p>
          <p>In her sepulchre there by the sea—</p>
          <p>In her tomb by the sounding sea.</p>

          <p>An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,</p>
          <p>Exhales from out her golden rim,</p>

          <p>Upon the quiet mountain top,</p>

          <p>Looking like Lethe, see! the lake</p>
          <p>A conscious slumber seems to take,</p>
          <p>And would not, for the world, awake.</p>
          <p>All Beauty sleeps!—and lo! where lies</p>
